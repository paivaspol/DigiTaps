Taking part in this study is voluntary. You can stop at any time. We will code all study information and it will be stored securely. We will record your age and some answers to questions about accessibility preferences. We will also collect data on the groups of numbers you are presented, the numbers you enter, the time of each entry, and the gestures you make on the screen. We will not link this data to identifying information about you.

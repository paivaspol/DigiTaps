TapInput

Should it send JSON object instead?

DB Schema
  User(pid int primary key, firstname text, lastname text, age int, isBlind boolean)
  Event(pid references User, gameId int, taskId int, time datetime?, params string)
  
  
  Event -> GameStart, GameEnd, GestureTap, GestureSwipe, 
  
  many-to-many relationship
  
  User play Game -- one-to-many --> Events
  
  
Local cache:
  - Store in a NSArray locally, in a file
    [
      Event1(pid),
      Event2(pid),
      Event3(pid),
      ...
      EventN(pid)
    ]
    NOOOO!
  - Use core data instead. It's easier to deal with.
  
Timeline
  1) Get the cache done when log, always send it to CoreData
  2) Build a quick server
  
Thread #1: The game -> sends log to Core Data
Thread #2: Keep sending the logs to the server


DemographicsViewController --> fill in the necessary form items, then send a uid request to the server
